#### Goals and Expectations for the Project (What does each group member hope to get out of this project?)

 * Jeremiah - Let's finish - making through the last iteration. 
 * Melissa - Planning out a project, clearly understand each step before starting to code.  Speak your anxieties on what we are getting anxious about.  
 * Bill - understand webpack & sass - posts/fetch


#### What do we want to achieve as a team? How will we know that we're successful?):

We are collaborating as much as possible.  When everyone understands what is going on with the code.  

#### Team strengths & collaboration styles (consider discussing your Pairin qualities here):

* Jeremiah - sketching out whole project, conflict resolution.  
* Melissa - Pom patrol. DRY code.  I'm good at getting everyone's input and moving forward effectively. Would rather front load the work.  
* Bill - I'm very understanding and solving problems, I'm great at finding solutions. 

#### How we can use our strengths to overcome obstacles:

* Jeremiah - I will always have a point of reference.  I won't allow myself to be lost in the project. 
* Melissa - decision making, struggle/to ask for help. 
* Bill -  empathy, understanding with scheduling conflicts.  

#### Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually? What constraints do we have?):

* Jeremiah - done with project by 8pm, I'm cool. 
* Melissa - time off to eat/Sunshine, time to review next days lesson plan, JS Fun, mentor time Tues 3:30 - 4:30.  Thursday/Friday
* Bill - pebble Mon @ 5, dinner @ 6:30

#### Communication Expectations (How and often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open?

* Stand ups - daily, in afternoon. 2.5 hours at least, to get started. 


#### Abilities & Growth Expectations (Technical strengths and areas for desired improvement):

* Jeremiah -  
* Melissa - growth in visualing code, being able to process the bigger picture, planning fetching/posting  
* Bill - manipulate data on a bigger scale, fetching/posting. 


#### Workload Expectations (What features do we each want to work on?):

* group project time mostly - to learn the new webpack abilities. 

#### Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests/Debugging and Problem-solving Techniques):

project board, will discuss in daily standups.  

#### Expectations for giving and receiving feedback:

 * Jeremiah - I don't want the mindset of anyone's code being "better" than others.  Communicate if code understanding is missing. 
 * Melissa - needs realtime feedback, needs someone to let me know when I'm digging my heels in.
 * Bill - open, clear communication.  I like positive affirmation - giving/receiving, good when working together. 


#### Project management tools we will use (GitHub projects or Trello are popular tools):

GitHub projects

#### Day 1 Agenda:
